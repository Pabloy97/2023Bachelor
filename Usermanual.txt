A User manual
Firstly to use the tool one has to download Elasticsearch and Kibana. Then run
the program. The script containing the flask code has to be running to access the
website.
To access the website as it is now, access using localhost:5000 to access the home
page. From the homepage you will be able to see all the visualizations that were
created from the Kibana instance. These visualizations are interact able by clicking
and dragging over areas in the graphs to get a closer look at the data.
You can navigate to different sites using the navigation bar at the top of the website.
Here lays all the other access able pages in the website. Example if you would like
to create your own visualizations which you can not do in the home page, navigate
to the Make Visualization page and follow what is displayed on the screen to create
visualizations. This tool does not yet have a function to save the visualization on
the web-page.
If there are any other questions you could navigate to the help section which has
information about the website and issues that can arise when creating a visualization.
